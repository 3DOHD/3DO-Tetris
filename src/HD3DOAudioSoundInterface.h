Change History:
07/27/93	Initial Version.
08/10/93	Removed instrument file name parameter from load RAM sound; the instrument
			is now determined automagically.
08/11/93	Inherited some changes by Leo.
08/16/93	Removed isStereo flag from LoadRAMSound. Stereo/Mono determination is done
			automatically. Added kStopFadeSpoolSound command and SpoolFadeSoundRec
			data structure.
08/30/93	Add: kIsSoundSpooling function. Returns true if sound currently spooling.
			Modified to work under DragonTail5.
09/01/93	Add instrument cacheing. The first MAX_CACHED_INSTRUMENTS are cached in RAM
			and not reloaded from disk every time they're used. Once the cache is full,
			there is no replacement strategy.
09/08/93	Moved away from a channel-dependent philosophy. You can now load more sounds
			than you have channels for or than you have room for on the dsp. Intruments
			will get loaded into the dsp and unloaded as needed.
09/16/93	Space is now reserved in the dsp for a spooler instrument (currently I use
			halfmono8.dsp to determine the size because it takes up a lot of room and trying
			to use fixedstereosample.dsp didn't save enough). This should prevent the
			loading of too many RAM sounds precluding the use of the dsp for spooling.
			DSP instruments I use (the mixer, the envelope, and the spooler room reserver)
			no longer have pathnames, as they are not needed.

// Each Sound you create must have a unique number that you refer to it by when you
// load it, play it, stop it, or unload it. A value of 0 means a channel has not been
// allocated, so don't use it. For example:

enum {
	kSoundOne = 1, 
	kSoundTwo,
	kSoundThree
};

// I will cache the first n unqiue instruments for quick retrieval where n is the
// value defined by MAX_CACHED_INSTRUMENTS. There is no cache replacement; once the
// cache is full, no more instruments are cached.

#define	MAX_CACHED_INSTRUMENTS	8

// This is the maximum number of ram sounds you can "load". Loading a sound just means
// that the sample data is in memory. It is possible to load more than maximum number
// of sounds that can play at one time either because the dsp is out of memory or because
// there are no more mixer channels available.
